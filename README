File copy application for OpenWRT.

Reason for writing this is that it enables my Kingston Mobilelite Wireless
MLWG2 device to do file copying.
Out of the box the vendor firmware (and android app) does this through the
phone, meaning if I disconnect from wifi the copy stops, or if I want to
keep the phone battery charge!

Hooked into the web admin page under Administration > Services > File Copy.

To deploy, copy luci-filecopy/dist into root and enable execute permission
for the /sbin/noisycopy script.

Tested with OpenWRT Barrier Breaker r44874 and Firefox 40.0.
